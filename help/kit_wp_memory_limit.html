<header>Memory limit</header>

This is the maximum amount of memory that a script is allowed to
allocate on your WordPress site. Itâ€™s like setting a limit on how
much memory individual tasks can use at a time. If your site is small
to medium-sized, the default 40M might be enough. But if you have a
lot of plugins or complex scripts, you might need to increase this limit.
