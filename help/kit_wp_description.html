<header>Site description</header>

This is usually a short text that explains what your site is about. It's often 
displayed right under the site name on your homepage and can also be used in
the metadata that search engines use to describe your site in search results.
This description can be important for SEO because it can influence whether
users decide to click through to your site from search results.
