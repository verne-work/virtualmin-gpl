<header>Enable Fail2Ban protection</header>

Enabling Fail2Ban for your WordPress site is an excellent way to protect it from
brute force attacks. By enabling this option, a custom filter will be added to
your Fail2Ban service configuration, using web server logs. This filter will
monitor failed login attempts on your WordPress site and block the IP addresses
of attackers with multiple failed login attempts for a certain period of time.<p>
