<header>Enable maintenance mode</header>

This option lets you put your site in a state where visitors know
you're making updates or changes.<p>

When maintenance mode is enabled, visitors will see a
message that says your site is in maintenance mode. You can customize
maintenance page by putting custom <tt>maintenance.php</tt> file in
<tt>wp-content</tt> directory.
