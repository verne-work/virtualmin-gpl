<header>Admin Memory Limit</header>

This is often set higher than the regular memory limit and applies
specifically to the administrative back-end of WordPress. When youâ€™re
running plugin installations, upgrades, or other admin tasks, they often
require more memory. This setting ensures that your admin area has enough
memory to function efficiently without running into memory exhaustion
errors. <p>
