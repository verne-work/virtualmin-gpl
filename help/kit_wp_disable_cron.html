<header>Disable cron job scheduler</header>

Disables WordPress's automatic cron job scheduling, which is useful during
database migrations or when using an external scheduler to avoid conflicts.<p>

However, it is generally not recommended to disable the cron job scheduler, as
it is used by WordPress to perform various tasks such as checking for updates,
publishing scheduled posts, and more.
