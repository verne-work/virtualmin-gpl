<header>Enable trackbacks</header>

Trackbacks are similar to pingbacks, but they're more manual. When
you write a blog post and include a link to another blog that has
trackbacks enabled, you can send them a trackback notification.
This is not done automatically like pingbacks; you usually have to
enter the trackback URL provided by the other blog when you publish
your post. Trackbacks also appear like comments on the other personâ€™s
blog post to indicate that someone has linked to their content. The
difference is that trackbacks can include a title and an excerpt of
the content, and they don't require both blogs to be WordPress-based.
